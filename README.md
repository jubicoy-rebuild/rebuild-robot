# RE:BUILD

## Remote Controlled Robot Powered By C.H.I.P (Robot and API part)

Your task is to finish the robot and to build an API for controlling it. Provide API calls for basic movement first, and later
you can add combinations and tricks etc. Build camera stream to be used in controller application. Add some sort of authentication to make the system
secure. Provide good documentation for the group that is working with controller application for the same robot.

Focus on:
- Providing working API for robot's basic movement
- Good documentation for using the API
- Stream the camera to be used with front end
- Add more functionalities to API
