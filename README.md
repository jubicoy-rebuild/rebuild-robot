# RE:BUILD

## Remote Controlled Robot Powered By C.H.I.P

Your task is to build API and visual front-end for controlling the rover robot. Attach camera to robot and stream it to your front-end.
Add controls that are easy for users to use, and optionally provide some sort of authentication.

Optionally you can develop Android application that uses the bluetooth of the C.H.I.P for controlling the robot. If you have time you can add more functionalities
such as speech controlling etc. Use your imagination!

Focus on:
- Providing working controls for the robot
- Stream the camera to your front-end
- Add more functionalities to robot
- Documentation so that others are able to test the robot aswel
